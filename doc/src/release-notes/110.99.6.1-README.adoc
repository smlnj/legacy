== Patch Release 110.99.6.1

This patch release fixes a critical bug in 110.99.6.  In addition, there are
three other minor changes that were planned for 110.99.7.  The changes
are:

* Fix for Issue #328 (`Real.fromString` broken in 110.99.5 and 110.99.6)

* Added `Unsafe.Array.create0` for creating zero-length polymorphic arrays.

* Changed the version banner to match the format used in the development
  repository.  This change means that the release date will be displayed
  instead of the build date.

* Added `rawArray` and `rawObject` decoders to the `JSONDecode` structure
  in the SML/NJ Library.

The remainder of this document consists of the 110.99.6 release notes.

== Summary

The primary purpose of this release is to enable support for **macOS** 15 (Sequoia),
but it also contains a number of minor bug fixes.

== Details

=== Compiler

* The fusing of conversions between integer and word types has been improved.
  Basically, we have switched from only fusing operations that are adjacent
  in the CPS IR to fusing operations that are logically adjacent (_i.e._, there
  is a def-use dependency between them).

=== SML/NJ Library

There were a number of bug fixes to the Library (see the **Bugs** section below).
In addition, the following changes were made:

* Added the `combineWith` function to the various implementations of the
  `ORD_SET` signature.

* Some minor improvements to hash sets and integer hash tables.

* Fixed the reporting of field-not-found errors in JSON library (the error
  message was garbled).

* Fixed some bugs in the new JSON parser.  The first byte of a UTF-8
  sequence was being dropped and comments were only allowed immediately
  in front of values.  There was also a problem with Unicode escape sequences
  in strings that has been fixed.

 * Refactored how error exceptions are used in the `JSONDecode` and `JSONUtil`
  modules.  The new design, which follows the Basis Library pattern of
  the `IO.Io` exception, uses a single `JSONError` exception for all errors.
  The `JSONError` exception has two arguments: the first is an exception
  that details the particular kind of error and the second is the JSON value
  that was being processed when the error was detected.
  Note that this change will break code that is explicitly matching on the
  exceptions defined in the `JSONDecode` and `JSONUtil` modules.

=== Installation

Installation on **macOS** 15 (Sequoia) is now supported.

== Bugs

Here is a list of the issues that are fixed (or closed) with this release.
We include the original bug numbers for bugs that were reported using the
gforge bug tracker.

|=======

The system also works on Apple Silicon using Rosetta2.

=== 32-bit macOS issues

While the {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[x86 installer]
for {version} works on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave, building from source
requires some extra steps because the version of **Xcode**
distributed for Mojave does not include a 32-bit SDK.

Another issue that you may encounter
when building on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave is an error message for a shell
script of the form

.....
  /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted
.....

This error arises because the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is set on the
shell script.  To fix the problem, remove the attribute using the command

[source,shell]
-----
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shell-script
-----
and resume the build.
