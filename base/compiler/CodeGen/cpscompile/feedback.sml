 * original version by: Andrew Appel (appel@cs.princeton.edu) (is this right?)
 *
 * recent cleanup by: Matthias Blume (blume@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp)
 *    The cleanup involves getting rid of duplicate SCC code (using
 *    the library module GraphSCCFn) and making use of integer set-
 *    and map-modules (from the same library).  The use of SortedList
 *    has been eliminated, using LambdaVar.Set in its place.
