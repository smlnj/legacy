Working notes for branch dbm2

Revising

* defn and use (and possibly the name) of CompInfo
* Source (inputSource type) and ErrorMsg
   - source could be (partially) absorbed into CompInfo or its successor.
     But what about the sourceMap component of source.
   - ErrorMsg can be simplified by having it depend on CompInfo for the source.

* added TyvarSet
  When used in absyn (VB constructor arg) in place of tyvar list,
  needs to be defined in a library prior to absyn (Parser/parser.cm).
  Where does it belong. Note that TyvarSet depends on Types.
  So we need

      Types --> TyvarSet --> absyn

  We already have

      Types --> absyn

  It should suffice to move TyvarSet from Elaborator/elaborate to ElabData/types.

  >> Elaborator/elaborate/tyvarset.sml moved to ElabData/types/tyvarset.sml
  and Elaborator/elaborate.cm and ElabData/elabdata.cm edited accordingly.
